Loans pay interest to investors and publicize indicators of expected social impact. Financial returns significantly influence investors' decisions: a one percentage point increase in the interest rate increases funding speed seven-fold, investment probability two-fold and transaction size by 122 Euro. Expected social impact influences investors' perception but has no influence (for female empowerment, employees and beneficiaries) or limited influence (for turnover) on investors' funding decisions. When all available loans pay the same interest rates, female borrowers - but not firms with many employees or beneficiaries - are more likely to be chosen, suggesting that variation in financial returns can crowd out salient dimensions of social impact. The study implies that peer-to-peer lending platforms should function as gatekeepers of social impact and cannot outsource the evaluation of social impact to retail impact investors.\n\n```{=html}\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I’m excited to share my first-ever publication 🥳<br><br>At times doing a PhD feels like filling a pool with water one cup at a time and it&#39;s difficult to see progress.

Link to [working paper](pdfs/wp_ripe-contracts.pdf) and [to presentation](https://jolly-goldwasser-9c4a03.netlify.app/#1)\n> We evaluate the impact of a multi-layered contract farming intervention that connected smallholder farmers in central Kenya to avocado exporting companies, provided training in good agricultural practices and certified farmer organizations according to the global good agricultural practices (GAP) production standard. Using panel data from 2015 and 2017 we show that the intervention was successful at delivering its immediate goals. It increased the share of farmers that sold to companies, were recently trained and received the GAP certification. Contract farming significantly improved the sales prices of farmers, and knowledge of avocado-farming practices and led to increased investments into the Hass avocado variety which is in higher demand in export markets. We find suggestive, albeit not statistically significant, evidence that contract farming improved farmer income and shifted labour from family to hired labour. At the same time, contract farmers produced less of the local avocado variety, leading to a significant decrease in total quantity sold during the transition to the export-oriented Hass avocado variety. We contribute to the literature by quantifying the impact of a multi-layered contract farming intervention. Panel data allows us to estimate a doubly-robust difference-in-differences design, giving us more confidence to interpret our estimates as causal evidence of contract farming than traditional cross-sectional studies allow for.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nI focus on innovative forms of financing sustainable economic development, from impact investing to agricultural finance.
